# openlcbr

This is an open reimplementation of the IBP algorithm [1] as per the assumptions made in [2]. It is still fairly rough and subject to many revisions but the code should be readable and the algorithm understandable.

## Requirements

Python 3

## How to use:

``python3 lcbr.py data/trade-secret-cases.yaml``

... should produce this:

``` 
== open ibp test ==
loading: data/trade-secret-cases.yaml

predicting info_trade_secret
predicting info_valuable

which is CORRECT
```

## Future Work

* lots of debugging, refactoring and adaptation
* add implementations of HYPO and possibly CATO and VJAP
